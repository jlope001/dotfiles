# Dotfiles
My setup of dotfiles for my machines.

## Installation
To install, simply run the following command.

```
$ ./boostrap.sh
```

It will install zsh + oh-my-zsh along with all aliases and shortcuts I need to get stuff done.

## Private dotfiles
If you need a way to store/load up private config settings, have a look at https://github.com/jlope001/dotfiles-private-example.  It'll give you a skeleton setup to load up private dotfiles.
